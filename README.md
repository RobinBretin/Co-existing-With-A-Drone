# Co-existing-With-A-Drone
This GitHub repository serves as an open-access data archive for my research study "Co-existing With Drones: A Virtual Exploration of Proxemic Behaviours and Usersâ€™ Insights on Social Drones". 

The Proxemic folder contains a .txt file for each participant which stores the following data:
- Participant's id,
- Height condition,
- Framing condition,
- Participant's x position
- Participant's y position
- Participant's z position
- Drone x position
- Drone y position
- Drone z position
- Distance between the drone and the participant
- Participant's velocity
- Time
